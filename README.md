# Ames Housing Price Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on the Ames Housing dataset. The model applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier handling, and a linear regression model to estimate home prices.

## 📁 Files in this Repository

- `AmesHousing[1].csv`: Raw dataset with housing information.
- `ML_project_housing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code, EDA, and model building.
- `project_summary.md`: Brief summary of findings, performance, and insights.
- `images/`: Folder containing visualizations and screenshots.

## 🔍 Features of the Dataset

The dataset contains 82 variables related to housing features, such as:
- Location
- Lot size
- Quality scores
- Number of rooms, bathrooms
- Garage, basement, and porch features
- Sale price (target variable)

## 🧪 Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values handling and type conversions.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Insights via visualizations and summary statistics.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Conversion of categorical variables, dropping irrelevant columns.
4. **Modeling**: Linear regression model trained and evaluated.

## 📊 Key Screenshots

Add the following screenshots in the `images/` folder:
- `correlation-heatmap.png`: Correlation matrix showing relationships with SalePrice.
- `model-performance.png`: Residual plot or R² score output showing model evaluation.

## 🧠 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to go from raw data to a predictive model using Python and common data science libraries.
